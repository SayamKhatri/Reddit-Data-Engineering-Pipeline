1j6lrxq,"Is ""Medallion Architecture"" an actual architecture?","With the term ""architecture"" seemingly thrown around with wild abandon with every new term that appears, I'm left wondering if ""medallion architecture"" is an actual ""architecture""?  Reason I ask is that when looking at ""data architectures"" (and I'll try and keep it simple and in the context of BI/Analytics etc) we can pick a pattern, be it a ""Data Mesh"", a ""Data Lakehouse"", ""Modern Data Warehouse"" etc but then we can use data loading patterns within these architectures...  

So is it valid to say ""I'm building a Data Mesh architecture and I'll be using the Medallion architecture""....  sounds like using an architecture within an architecture...

I'm then thinking ""well, I can call medallion a pattern"", but then is ""pattern"" just another word for architecture?  Is it just semantics?

Any thoughts appreciated

1j66s7j,Open-Source ETL to prepare data for RAG 🦀 🐍,"I’ve built an open source ETL framework (CocoIndex) to prepare data for RAG with my friend. 

# 🔥 Features:

* Data flow programming
* Support custom logic - you can plugin your own choice of chunking, embedding, vector stores; plugin your own logic like lego. We have three examples in the repo for now. In the long run, we also want to support dedupe, reconcile etc.
* Incremental updates. We provide state management out-of-box to minimize re-computation. Right now, it checks if a file from a data source is updated. In future, it will be at smaller granularity, e.g., at chunk level.

1j6gh1p,"Looking for Courses on Spark Internals, Optimization, and AWS Glue","Hi all,

I’m looking for recommendations on a good Spark course that dives into its internals, how it processes data, and optimization techniques.

My background:

	• I’m proficient in Python and SQL.
	• My company is mostly an AWS shop, and we use AWS Glue for data processing.
	• We primarily use Glue to load data into S3 or extract from S3 to S3/Redshift.
	• I mostly write Spark SQL as we have a framework that takes Spark SQL.
	• I can optimize SQL queries but don’t have a deep understanding of Spark-specific optimizations or how to determine the right number of DPUs for a job.

I understand some of this comes with experience, but I’d love a structured course that can help me gain a solid understanding of Spark internals, execution plans, and best practices for Glue-specific optimizations.

Any recommendations on courses (Udemy, Coursera, Pluralsight, etc.) or other resources that helped you would be greatly appreciated!

1j68rcv,Data Modelling for Power BI,"I primarily work with Power BI but am looking to start developing dimension tables. I am looking to build a STAR schema model and am struggling with the organisation dimension. I have a fact table that contains the business unit codes and description for each of the 5 levels of the organisation totaling 10 columns for organisation attributes. I would like to be able to replace these 10 columns with a single column that can be used to form a relationship between the fact and a denormalised organisation dimension. 

Currently there are 5 normalised 'reference' tables for each level of the hierarchy but there appears to be errors in them. It seems like they've used a Type 2 SCD approach but haven't applied a surrogate key to differentiate between the versions so there's no column with unique values required for forming relationships in Power BI if I decided to go with a snowflaking schema instead. Also the active flags are incorrect in some cases with end dates in the past still being set to active rows. 

I came across a Type 6 dimension in Kimball's book which would be ideal to accommodate restructures as I have certain metrics which requires 12 months of continuous data so if a tier 2 business unit becomes part of a brand new tier 1 business unit, having a column that captures the current tier 1 and overwrites the tier 1 value for previous records in this column and another that captured the tier 1 at the time of the row creation would be super helpful.

However, I'm struggling with the HOW aspect but am considering the following process:

1. I will base my source of truth on the system used to publish our organisational hierarchy online.
2. Pull data daily and put into temporary reference tables.
3. For each reference table I will compare it with the temporary one and I will look to check if there's any new additions, disestablished units, or changes in their parent/child relationship and then make appropriate changes to the permanent reference table which should also have a surrogate key added.
4. For new additions, add a new row. For disestablished units, close off the end date and set the flag as inactive. I'd assume dependent units below will either be disestablished too or reassigned to a new unit. For changes to parent, I would need to add a new row, close off the previous, and overwrite the current column with the new value for any previous rows.
5. Finally I would join them together in a view/table and add a unique identifier for each row which would then be used in the fact tables replacing the previous 10 columns with 1.

I feel like there's a lot of considerations I still need to factor in but is the process at least on the right path (I've attached a couple images of the proposed vs current situation). The next stage would be considering how to implement this dimension for fact table generated by different source systems each generating different natural keys for the same business unit

1j6fu4j,Datawarehouse Architecture,"I am trying to redesign the current data architecture we have in place at my work.

Current Architecture:

- Store source data files on an on-premise server

- We have a on-premise SQL server. There are three types of schema on this SQL server to differentiate between staging, post staging and final tables. 

- We run some SSIS jobs in combination with python scripts to pre-process, clean and import data into SQL server staging schema. These jobs are scheduled using batch scripts.

- Then run stored procedures to transform data into post staging tables.

- Lastly, aggregate data from post staging table into big summary tables which are used for machine learning

The summary tables are several millions rows and aggregating the data from intermediate tables takes several minutes. We are scaling so this time will increase drastically as we onboard new clients. Also, all our data is consumed by ML engineers, so I think having an OLTP database does not make sense as we depend mostly on aggregated data.

My proposition:
- Use ADF to orchestrate the current SSIS and python jobs to eliminate batch scripts.
- Create a staging area in data warehouse such as Databricks. 
- Leverage spark instead of stored procedures for transforming data in databricks to create post staging tables.
- Finally aggregate all this data into big summary tables. 

Now I am confused about where to keep the staging data? 
Should I just ingest data onto on-premise SQL server and use databricks to connect to this server and run transformations? Or do I create my staging tables within databricks itself? 

Two reasons to keep staging data on premise: 
- cost to ingest is none
- Sometimes the ML engineers need to create adhoc summary tables from post staging tables, and this will be costly operations in databricks if they do this very often

1j68y2u,Seeking Advice for Replacing Company Technology Stack,"# Intro and what I'm hoping to get help for:

Hello! I'm hoping to get some advice and feedback for some good technology solutions to replace the current stack we use at my work.

I am a tech lead at a software company where we build platforms for fairly large businesses. The platform itself runs on an MS SQL Server backend, with .NET and a bunch of other stuff that isn't super relevant to this post. The platform is customer centric and maintains full client data, history, and transactional history.

Several years ago I transitioned into the team responsible for migrating the client data onto our platform (directly into the SQL Server) as part of the delivery, and I'm now in a lead position where I can drive the technology decisions. 

# Details of what we currently do:

Our migrations are commonly anywhere from a few hundred thousand customers to a million or so (our largest was around 1.5 million in a single tranche from memory) and our transactional data sets are probably on average a several hundred million with the largest being a couple of billion.

Our ETL process has evolved over time and become quite mature, but our underlying technology has not in my opinion. We are using SSIS for 95% of stuff, and by this I mean like full on using all of the SISS components for all transformations, not just using stored procs wrapped in source components.

I am completely exhausted by it and absolutely need a change. There are so many issues with SSIS that I probably don't need to convince anyone on this sub of, but especially in the way we use it. Our platforms are always slightly customised for each client so we can't just transform the client data into a standard schema and load it in, the actual targets are often changing as well, and SSIS just doesn't scale well for quick development and turn around of new implementations, reuse or even having multiple developers working on it at once (good luck doing a git merge of your 10 conflicted dtsx files).

From a technical perspective I'm convinced we need a change, but migrations are not just technical, the process, risk acceptance, business logic, audit etc etc are all just as fundamental so I will need to be able to convince management that if we change technology, we will still be able to maintain the overall mature process that we have.

# Requirements

At a super high level our pipelines often look something like:

1. Extract from any sort of source system (files, direct DB, DB backups etc)
2. Stage raw extracted data into separate ETL SQL Server (outside of the platform production)
3. Several layers of scoping, staging, transformations to get data into our standardised schema format
4. Audit / Rec Reports, retrieve sign off from clients
5. Validation
6. Audit / Rec Reports, retrieve sign off from clients
7. Transform into target platform format
8. Audit / Rec Reports (internal only)
9. Load to target
10. Audit / Rec Reports (retrieve sign off from clients)

Because of the way SSIS loads from and to existing SQL tables, the above means that we have data staged at every layer so analysts and testers can always view the data lineage and how it transformed over time.

Another key thing is that if we ever have to hotfix data, we can start the process from any given layer.

These servers and deployments are hosted in on prem data centres that we manage.

At least to start off with, I doubt I could convince business management to move away very far from this process, even though I don't think we would necessarily need to have so many staging layers, and I think if it made sense moving the pipeline to cloud servers rather than on prem could be convinced.

# Options

Currently I am heavily leaning to towards Spark with Python. Reasons would along the lines of:

* Python is very fast to implement and make changes
* Scales very well from an implementation perspective, i.e. it would be reasonable to have several developers working within the same python modules for transactions across different entities, whereas SSIS is a nightmare
* Reuse of logic is extremely easy, can make a standard library of common transformations and just import
* Can scale performance of the load by adding new machines to the spark cluster, which is handy because our data volumes are often quite varied between projects

I've created a few PySpark demo projects locally and it's fantastic to use (and honestly just a joy to be using python again), but one thing I've noticed is that Spark isn't precious about loading data, it'll happily keep everything in dataframes until you need to do something with it.

This makes all of our staging layers from the above process slightly awkward, I.e. it's a performance hit to load data to an SQL Server, but if I wanted to maintain the above process so that other users would be able to view the data lineage, and even hotfix + start from point of failure, I would need to design the Spark pipeline to constantly be dumping data to SQL Server which seems potentially redundant.

As for other options, I don't want to go anywhere near AzureDataFactory - it kind of just seems like a worse version of SSIS to be honest. I've looked at Pandas but it seems like for our volumes Spark is probably better. There were a bunch of other things I briefly looked at, but many of them seem to be more Data Warehouse / Data Lake related which is not what we're doing here, it's a pure ETL pipeline

# End

I would super appreciate to hear from anyone much smarter and more experienced than me if I am on the right track, any other options that might be suitable for my use case, and any other general thoughts whatsoever.
